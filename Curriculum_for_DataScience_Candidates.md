# Introduction

I finished Spring Board data science career track. They gave us a curriculum as a guide. This one is not the best but it is helpful. By adding my own experience and my friends' experience I will try to make a new helpful curriculum. I want to share my curriculum for those who are seeking to be a data scientist on their on path.


## Study Plan

1. What is Data Science?

You can watch these two videos, they will give you some idea about data science and scientist

- ["What is Data Science?" by Cathy O'Neil, Rachel Schutt](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/doing-data-science/9781449363871/ch01.html)
  
- [What Is A Data Scientist?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQBat7e0MQs)


2. Programmning (Python for Data Science)

There are tons of courses and websites on learning coding. I used Datacamp website to learn Python. There are also very beatiful courses on Coursera.


2.1.  Intro

- [Introduction to Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
- [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python)

- [Data Types for Data Science in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-types-for-data-science ) 
	
- [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1)
	
- [Introduction to Data Visualization in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-python)
	
	

2.2.  Data Wrangling

- [Pandas Foundations](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations )
- [Manipulating DataFrames with Pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/manipulating-dataframes-with-pandas )
- [Merging DataFrames with Pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/merging-dataframes-with-pandas)
- [Cleaning Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python)  


2.3.  Working with Data in Files

- [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2 ) 
- [Importing Data in Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1) 
- [Importing Data in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-2) 


3. SQL (Working with Data in Databases)

SQL is an important skill of a datascientist. Mostly you will be asked SQL questions in data science job interviews.

- [Learn SQL with Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)
- [Analytics Training with Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-business-analytics-training/)
	

4.  Web Scrapping, Collecting Data from the Internet

As a datascientist you might need to collect your data from internet. Internet is a very huge and deep source for any data but you have know how to extract data from a webpage. These two sources are a good starting point. 

- [Introduction to APIs](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/11/an-introduction-to-apis-application-programming-interfaces-5-apis-a-data-scientist-must-know/ )
- [Getting Started With Python Requests](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-python-requests-get-requests )
